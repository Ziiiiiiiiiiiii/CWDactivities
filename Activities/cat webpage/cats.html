        <p>"Asia was rescued around the same time that the Miss Earth pageant was taking place in 2017. This Little
          Miss showed that she is confidently beautiful with heart by winning a place at Cats & Crumbs, which is
          Marikina's first cat cafe and a partner of the PAWS shelter. Hopefully she also wins a place in your

        <h5>Chino’s Story</h5>
        <p>"This is an inspiring story of survival. When Chino was rescued, we discovered that someone had played a
          cruel joke and poked one of his eyes with a BBQ stick, which is why he is now a one-eyed cutie.</p>
        <p>Despite this traumatizing experience, Chino has become a well-adjusted cat that is happiest when he gets
          lots of attention and playtime. In fact, we don’t think he knows he has a disability! He is labeled a
          special needs cat only because people look at him differently. He is in fact no different than the
          average cat – only more playful!"</p>

        <h5>Ofella’s Story</h5>
        <p>"
          It was just another day for Ofella as she roams around her neighborhood, until she encountered a vehicle
          speeding directly towards her. The next thing she knew, she was laying on the ground with a broken hind
          leg. The driver sped away of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ofella, still bleeding and in pain, limped to her house only to find out that her owner, the person she
          loved and trusted the most would simply turn her away. A kind-hearted woman that saw her plight decided
          to rescue poor Ofella and bring her to PAWS where she was treated. Despite the physical injury and
          neglect experienced from her owner, she remained a positive and happy kitty."

              <p>Not to be confused with the Domestic Shorthair, the American Shorthair is descended
                from
                ships' cats brought over by European settlers, and it's a tough breed that became
                this
                way thanks to a hard life of hunting rats in an inhospitable colony.</p>
              <p>
                A solidly-built heavyweight of the feline world (male cats can weigh up to 15
                pounds),
                the American Shorthair is a recognized pedigree breed but also a working cat that
                loves to
                hunt; you'll need to keep it supplied with exciting toys if you don't want to be
                inundated
                with furry or feathery gifts. American Shorthairs also tend to be affectionate,
                easy-going
                pets.

              <p>If you've ever wished a cat could be more like a dog, a Ragdoll is probably the breed
                for
                you. Originally bred in the 1960s, Ragdolls are well-known for their laid-back and
                affectionate nature, while their tendency to go limp when picked up will make them
                extremely attractive to anyone who's had to take a furious ball of teeth and claws
                to
                the vet.</p>

              <p>Like the Domestic Shorthair, the Domestic Longhair is a melting pot of feline
                genetics
                that comes in every shape, size and color. The big difference, of course, is the
                longer hair;
                it's thought that this breed originated in Russia, Turkey and Iran, where the
                weather
                gets colder in winter than in the warmer climates where the domestic cat originated.
                As with
                the Domestic Shorthair, these regal-looking moggies make excellent pets.</p>
